        <h2> What are PWAs?</h2>
        <p>A <span class= "highlight">progressive web application </span>(PWA) is a website built with modern web technologies that 
            provides a user experience similar to a native mobile or desktop app. It combines the broad reach
            of the web with many advanced, app-like features. PWAs can be installed on a user's device directly
            from a web browser, and they can even function when the device is offline.</p>
