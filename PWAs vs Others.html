    <h2>Understanding the Differences</h2>
    <p>Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) offer a unique blend of features that set them apart from both 
        native apps and traditional websites. Below is a comparison of these three types of digital experiences:</p>

    <h3><u>Native Apps</u></h3>
    <p>Native apps are software applications developed specifically for a particular operating system, such as 
        iOS or Android. They are downloaded and installed from app stores and can access device hardware and features 
        directly. Native apps often provide the best performance and user experience, but they require separate 
        development for each platform, which can be costly and time-consuming.</p>

    <h3><u>Traditional Websites</u></h3>
    <p>Traditional websites are accessed through web browsers and are built using standard web technologies like 
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They are platform-independent and can be viewed on any device with a browser. 
        However, traditional websites typically lack advanced features like offline access, push notifications, and 
        home screen installation, which can limit their functionality compared to native apps.</p>

    <h3><u>Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)</u></h3>
    <p>PWAs combine the best of both worlds by leveraging modern web technologies to deliver an app-like 
        experience through a web browser. They can be installed on a user's device, work offline, send push 
        notifications, and provide fast loading times. PWAs are platform-independent, meaning they can run on any 
        device with a compatible browser, reducing development costs and time. While they may not always match 
        the performance of native apps, PWAs offer a highly accessible and engaging user experience.</p>
