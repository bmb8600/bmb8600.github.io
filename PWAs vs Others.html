            <h2>Understanding the Differences</h2>
            <p>Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) offer a unique blend of features that set them apart from both 
            native apps and traditional websites. Below is a comparison of these three types of digital experiences:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="comparison-sections">

            <div class="comparison-item">
                <h3><u>Native Apps</u></h3>
                <p><span class= "highlight">Native apps are software applications</span> developed specifically for a particular operating system, such as 
                    iOS or Android. They are downloaded and installed from app stores and can access device hardware and features 
                    directly. Native apps often provide the best performance and user experience, but they require separate 
                    development for each platform, which can be <span class= "highlight">costly and time-consuming</span></p>

                </figure>

            </div>

            <div class="comparison-item">
                <h3><u>Traditional Websites</u></h3>
                <p><span class= "highlight">Traditional websites are accessed through web browsers</span> and are built using standard web technologies like 
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They are <span class= "highlight">platform-independent</span> and can be viewed on any device with a browser. 
                    However, traditional websites typically <span class= "highlight">lack advanced features</span> like offline access, push notifications, and 
                    home screen installation, which can limit their functionality compared to native apps.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="comparison-item">
                <h3><u>Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)</u></h3>
                <p><span class= "highlight">PWAs combine the best of both worlds</span> by leveraging modern web technologies to deliver an app-like 
                experience through a web browser. They <span class= "highlight">can be installed</span> on a user's device, work offline, send push 
                notifications, and provide fast loading times. PWAs are <span class= "highlight">platform-independent,</span> so they can run on any 
                device with a compatible browser, reducing development costs and time. While they may not always match 
                the performance of native apps, PWAs offer a <span class= "highlight">highly accessible and engaging</span> user experience.</p>
