    <h2>Core Technologies Behind PWAs</h2>
    <p>Progressive Web Applications leverage several modern web technologies to deliver an app-like experience.</p> 
    <p>The key components include:</p>

    <!--I used the <u> tag to underline the headings. I used <h3> to make them a bit smaller than the other
    subheadings-->
    <h3><u>Service Workers</u></h3> 
    <p>Service workers are a core technology that make Progressive Web Applications work offline and load quickly.
        They are background scripts that run separately from the main web page, allowing the browser to intercept 
        network requests and decide how to handle them. For example, when a user visits a PWA, the service worker 
        can store or “cache” important files like images, HTML, and CSS so they can load instantly the next time — 
        even without an internet connection. Service workers also make features like push notifications and 
        background syncing possible, helping PWAs feel more like native mobile apps.</p>

    <h3><u>Web App Manifest</u></h3>
    <p>The Web App Manifest is a simple JSON file that tells the browser how the web application should look and 
        behave when installed on a device. It includes information such as the app's name, icons, theme color, 
        start page, and display mode (for example, whether it should open in full screen or within the browser). 
        This file allows users to add a PWA to their home screen just like a regular app, giving them quick access 
        and an immersive experience. Without the manifest, a PWA would behave like a normal website, but with it, 
        the site feels and functions more like a real app.</p>

    <h3><u>HTTPS</u></h3>
    <p>Progressive Web Applications must be served over HTTPS, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
        Secure. HTTPS ensures that all communication between the user's browser and the web server is encrypted and 
        secure. This protects users from data theft, tampering, and malicious attacks. It also allows PWAs to use 
        advanced browser features, since many of them — like service workers and location APIs — only work on secure 
        connections. HTTPS not only builds trust with users but is also a requirement for any website that wants to 
        be considered a true PWA.</p>

    <h3><u>Responsive Design</u></h3>
    <p>Responsive design is a web development approach that ensures a website or application looks and functions 
        properly on all devices, from large desktop screens to small smartphones. For PWAs, responsive design is 
        especially important because these applications are meant to provide a consistent, app-like experience across 
        platforms. Developers use flexible layouts, scalable images, and CSS media queries to adapt the interface to 
        different screen sizes and orientations. A PWA that is well-designed responsively feels natural to use, 
        no matter what device the user is on.</p>

    <h3><u>Progressive Enhancement</u></h3>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is a design strategy that focuses on building a basic, functional version of a 
        website that works for all users, and then adding more advanced features for browsers that support them. 
        This principle is what the “progressive” in Progressive Web Application refers to. For example, a PWA might 
        first load simple HTML and CSS so it works even on older devices, then add features like offline access or 
        notifications for users with modern browsers. This approach ensures accessibility, performance, and 
        reliability across all environments.</p>
    
    <h3><u>APIs</u></h3>
    <p>Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, allow PWAs to interact with device hardware and browser 
        features in ways that were once only possible for native apps. Through APIs, a PWA can access things like 
        the camera, GPS, microphone, or notifications — always with the user's permission. For instance, the 
        Geolocation API lets a PWA show nearby stores, while the Notifications API can send alerts when new
        content is available. These APIs expand what web apps can do, making PWAs more powerful and 
        interactive than traditional websites.</p>
